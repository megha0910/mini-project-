Transcriptomic Analysis of Differentially Expressed Genes in Type 2 Diabetes Using RNA-Seq

--> Overview:

This project explores transcriptomic data using RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) to identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and their biological significance. By integrating computational analysis with sequencing technologies, this study aims to reveal gene regulatory mechanisms, disease-associated biomarkers, and potential therapeutic targets. The findings contribute to understanding molecular pathways linked to disease progression and treatment strategies.
